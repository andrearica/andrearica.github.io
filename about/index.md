Hi friends, my name is Andy and welcome to my blog! 

I [dk](https://github.com/andrearica).

I started this site to tell the story of my tech journey. I believe in
**technology that is open, enabling, and life-giving**. I aspire to usher that
potential&mdash;even for just a tiny bit.  There is still a long way to go, and
this site records my progress. 

Here, you'll find some of my **thoughts, works, and notes** on software
development, systems, machine learning, and research. I hope that
you'll spend a nice time here, so go grab yourself a cup of coffee and feel
free to look around!
